This material belongs to the paper draft "Multiple Imputation of Ordinal Missing Not at Random Data" by A. Hammon

It contains the R functions for multiply imputing ordinal-scaled missing data under assuming MNAR that can be incorporated in Stef van Buuren's mice function as well as the package source of the package "bivprob.quad" that is required for estimating the ordered probit models with sample selection and random intercepts. In addition, I provide an extract of the conducted simulation studies.
