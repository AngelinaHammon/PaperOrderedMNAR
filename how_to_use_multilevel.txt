-> load "mice_heckman_ordered_re1.R" -> imputation algorithm with GHQ
-> load "mice_heckman_ordered_re2.R" -> imputation algorithm with AGHQ

-> installation and loading of mice 
-> installation and loading of bivprob.quad (bivprob.quad_2.0.tar.gz)

-> cluster id in the data set has to be assigned in the predictor matrix as -2
-> exclusion criterion has to be assigned in the predictor matrix as 1 and its variable name has to be specified with the excl="..." option in the mice function
-> for multivariate missing data use missing indicator of variable that is supposed to be MNAR as predictor for other incomplete variables


## little example with univariate missing data: ##

data <- data.frame(y,r,x1,x2,x3,group)  # data set 
# y is supposed to be MNAR, group is cluster id, x3 is exclusion criterion

ini <- mice(data,m=1,maxit=0) 
    
pred_MNAR <- ini$pred
pred_MNAR["y","r"] <- 0
pred_MNAR["y","group"] <- -2
   
mice(data,m=5,maxit=1,method=c("2l.heckman1step_ord_re_aghq","","","","",""),pred=pred_MNAR,print=F,QP=rep(10,2),draw=T,excl="x3")
# 2l.heckman1step_ord_re_aghq -> name of imputation function 
# draw -> set TRUE if parameters should be drawn from approximate normal posterior
# QP -> number of quadrature points for the two random intercepts (needs to be a vector of length 2)
# excl -> give variable name of exclusion criterion as a string
