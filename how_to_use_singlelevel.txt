-> load "mice_heckman_ordered.R" -> imputation algorithm 

-> installation and loading of mice 

-> exclusion criterion has to be assigned in the predictor matrix as 1 and its variable name has to be specified with the excl="..." option in the mice function
-> for multivariate missing data use missing indicator of variable that is supposed to be MNAR as predictor for other incomplete variables


## little example with univariate missing data: ##

data <- data.frame(y,r,x1,x2,x3)  # data set 
# y is supposed to be MNAR, x3 is exclusion criterion

ini <- mice(data,m=1,maxit=0) 
    
pred_MNAR <- ini$pred
pred_MNAR["y","r"] <- 0
   
mice(data,m=5,maxit=1,method=c("heckman1step_ord","","","",""),pred=pred_MNAR,print=F,draw=T,excl="x3")
# heckman1step_ord -> name of imputation function 
# draw -> set TRUE if parameters should be drawn from approximate normal posterior
# excl -> give variable name of exclusion criterion as a string
